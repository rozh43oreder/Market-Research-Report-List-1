<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inactivated Vaccine</li><li>Live Attenuated Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine market consists mainly of two types: inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain virus particles that have been killed, providing immunity without the risk of disease. They are typically safer and suitable for broader populations, including those with compromised immune systems. Live attenuated vaccines use weakened forms of the virus, offering stronger immune responses with fewer doses. However, they may have limitations for certain at-risk groups. Both types are crucial for preventing Japanese encephalitis.</p></p>
